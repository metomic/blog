# Fuck your banners, fuck your pop-ups, and fuck your feature walls
## Fuck your banners, fuck your pop-ups, and fuck your feature walls

About three months ago I met up with this dude called Richard at a pub in Moorgate. It was a job interview, but it didn’t feel like it. We talked at length about how the web, from a usability perspective, is long-gone. Nowadays, if you visit a website you’ll be bombarded with notification prompts, you’ll have a disgusting banner at the top or bottom of the page, and probably some bullshit discount or subscription prompt when you scroll halfway down the page.
