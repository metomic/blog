This week: your children are about to learn the skilful art of issuing voice commands ☞ non-racist AI? ☞ Zuckerberg finally gets deepfaked, the world rejoices

## In a shocking turn of events, AI has been used to combat bias instead of perpetuate it

San Fransisco are about to use AI to redact any information about race from police reports. This is so that police charge people based on what crimes they did, and perhaps not on what race they are, which is what they were doing up until now I guess?

The AI tool will strip out any indicators of race, including hair colour, eye colour, and name. It will even omit where that person lives incase police officers have any biases towards certain neighbourhoods. *It will even* remove information about the officer who took the report incase the prosecutor knows the officer and has any biases towards them and their decisions.

I'm finding it hard to find any problems with this so far; the AI used to redact information is pretty basic. So far justice systems have only been using unnecessarily sophisticated tools such as [racist facial recognition](https://blog.metomic.io/main/2019/06/05/tech-abuse.html) and [crappy algorithms that send innocent people to jail](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612775/algorithms-criminal-justice-ai/). So yeah, this is way of using AI has been eagerly awaited, I think.

## I am deeply offended by how deeply fake this is

So a few weeks ago there was a video of Nancy Pelosi bouncing around Facebook that made her look like she was drunk in the middle of an event. Firstly, points for maturity and originality go to whoever made the video. Secondly, [Facebook refused to take it down](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/24/facebook-leaves-fake-nancy-pelosi-video-on-site) even though it was fake. Now, please remember the difference between an **obvious playful fake** and an **extremely believable fake.** The Pelosi video was quite likely created to either sway or confirm the beliefs of people with certain political ideologies. Here's me thinking that social media giants were meant to diminish or prevent waves of dangerous misinformation, like a FOOL.

In a wonderful turn of events and spectacularly good commentary, artists Bill Poster and Daniel Howe just spunked out [a deepfake of Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ywyxex/deepfake-of-mark-zuckerberg-facebook-fake-video-policy) saying awful things with chilling sincerity. It really ticks all the boxes:

- It 'looks real' in that the deepfake behaves exactly as we know Zuckerberg to behave on video (this is the whole point of a deepfake, I know)
- In it he confirms that he is in fact our data-hungry overlord of the internet, just as we suspected.
- It looks like a clip taken from the news (very believable, no one watches the news on TV anymore except for people who do not know who Mark Zuckerberg is)

Facebook gave the video 'the same treatment' as the Pelosi video — it was not removed but it was less likely to appear on feeds etc. I wonder how different things would be if the Pelosi video never happened? 

Just to throw a spanner into shit-show, CBS requested that Facebook take the video down because it rips off their branding. That's right Facebook, the video must be removed not because it defames your king, but for boring corporate logo reasons that you cannot ignore. What a time to be alive.

## Let's play this new game called Echo Dot-to-Echo Dot, you'll love it

Don't you just... want your kids to shut up for a sec and interact with a virtual assistant?  I actually don't have kids so I have no idea what this is like and the answer could well be yes for most parents. Good news for those parents: Amazon are vastly improving their [Echo Dot for kids](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/12/18661751/amazon-new-echo-dot-kids-edition-third-generation-rainbow-price-specs-features).

Before we lose our minds and start moaning in fear that our children are being raised by robots and the prevalent memory they will have of growing up is the cool touch nanny cyborg tucking them into bed — relax. There's nothing you can do about it: the children will interact with technology whether you like it or not, and they will be better at it than you are. That's because they learned to use an iPad at age 5 instead of 25. 

Now, before anyone starts thinking 'you're right I should just fukin buy kids echo dot thingo right now,' please first as yourself these questions:

1. Do you really want to sit there while your child barks at Alexa to skip the ad and play another annoying children's song?
2. Are you saying you're actually comfortable having a [tool of corporate surveillance](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/05/06/alexa-has-been-eavesdropping-you-this-whole-time/?utm_term=.88fef90c45a8) just casually sitting in your house?
3. Do you... do you even *need* an Echo Dot? Like, do you?
