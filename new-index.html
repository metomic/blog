				Don’t blame technology for all the world’s problems — we’re just humans full of #emotions. It’s our fault.
			</h2>

			<p>
				And everyone was scared of it,even though it poses absolutely no threat whatsoever. All I can see is a fairly efficient way of delivering Amazon packages without polluting the earth even more. All anyone else could see was the beginning of the end of the world. Why? Because, it seems, there is a strange unreasonable fear of ‘technology getting out of control’. No. Humans are getting out of control.
			</p>

			<p>
				The video of the Amazon blimp churning out delivery drones is not real. It’s just a really good fake of a very believable landscape. One of the reasons why it inspired so much fear is because people really can see this happening. Again — there’s nothing scary about a blimp that helps deliver packages, just FYI.
